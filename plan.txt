plan:

- start off with a seed summoner(s) in summoner list

1. get a list of ALL unique summoner ids
  - iterate through summoner list:
    - iterate through all summoners in same league as summoner:
      - if summoner does not exist in database:
        - append summoner id to list
    - iterate through all match history:
      - if match does not exist in database:
        - download match / put match id in database
        - iterate through all summoners in match:
          - if summoner does not exist in database:
            - append summoner id to list
2. iterate through all summoner ids & record current rank DAILY
